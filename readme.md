A job queue with the goal of being _very_ simple. Made this mainly just as a "how to make/publish a crate."

This job queue is written purely with the standard library; it is not written with tokio/async-std in mind. I'm not sure if this poses an issue when using tokio/async-std, but to my knowledge it shouldn't cause an issue.
